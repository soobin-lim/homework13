# Dotenv
It is established in /config/connection.js file
Using .env file

# Model

Models are written using hasMany, belongsToMany


# findAll {include: {model: modelName }}

I didn't use 'as', 
so in findAll I just directly included Model's names.


# Sync and Seed

I matched Model's columns and Seed Data,
So It seeded successfully.
